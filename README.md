# ModCatDecoder
PRS Guitars comes with what people call MODCATs which can be read to determine the model and specifications of a guitar. This project began with an existing ModCat Decoder WebPage.
Please help us update it and modernize the code. Below are some suggestions on what I'm hoping we can improve:

## Adding/Updating Entries for MODCAT codes
That's really the reason why this project was formed. The MODCAT_data.js file contains all the model codes. 

## UX/UI
Right now it's a pretty basic HTML page. I'm sure we could make it look nicer. Help!

## Making the code easier to read and maintain.
I suggest following AirBnB's standards: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript 

## Add Tests
Jest or Cypress would be my preferred tools but if someone else writes them before I get to I'll learn whatever testing library or tool you use
